## Workflow steps
##### API for mod-notes_GET_POST.jmx
This JMX script tests both POST and GET /notes APIs equally, 50% of calls spent on POST and 50% on GET.
1. POST /notes
2. GET /notes/{noteId}

## Modules required to be enabled as a pre-requisite to run JMeter script

FOLIO release:
- Honeysuckle, or any release that has these two API cals

##### Backend:
- mod-notes
- okapi

##### Frontend:
N/A

## Usage
- Modify credentials.csv to have the correct values before running the script.
- The GET /notes call pulls from notes_ids.csv in jmeter-supported-data.
- notes_ids.csv is generated by retrieving the top 250K notes' IDs from the seed note data, see the Prerequisite section below. 

### Prerequisites:
- Need to run db-restore.sql and notes-data-load.sh scripts from /common/DBScripts/Notes
- db-restore.sql deletes all the notes in the database. Run it before and after a test.
- notes-data-load.sh seeds the data with 500K notes to give it an initial condition.  These 500K notes are from notes.json.tar.gz, also in the same directory
