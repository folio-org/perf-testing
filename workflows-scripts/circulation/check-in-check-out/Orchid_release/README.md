## Test Execution Steps
1. Make sure that the DB is clean by running checkin-checkout-db-restore.sql
2. Add seed data to mimic a database that already has loans and requests by running circ-data-load.sh
3. Run the test
(On carrier-io Jenkins job, specify the test name as "circulation_checkInCheckOut_orchid")
4. Clean up the DB afterward by running checkin-checkout-db-restore.sql to restore the database state.

## Artifacts and Usage
This package contains scripts to preload the database with loans and 
requests and to restore the database after running the test, as well as scripts used during test execution.
## Scripts
### Runtime Script
- BranchSelectorRandomizerScript.gvy: This script is used in the test. It randomizes the check in and check out requests based on a predefined percentage of checking-in or -out.
### Non-Runtime Scripts
- circ-data-load.sh: loads a 5000+ loans and 3000+ requests to mimic an inventory that has loans and requests. The data should be in the same directory as the script. In the github repo, data is in the circulation-seed-data.zip file.
- checkin-checkout-db-restore.sql: restores the DB to its original state. This script should be run after each test run to ensure that subsequent test runs have the same starting point.  This script truncates all loans and requests and their associated tables, and also restores all the inventory items' status to "Available".
These two scripts are to be run manually on the box that could connect to the database. 

To run the data load script:
1. Go to an AWS EC2 jump box that's in the same environment as that DB.
2. Download the folder that contains the seed data (circulation-seed-data.zip). Unzip it.
3. Navigate to the directory that contains the seed data files
4. Create a database configuration data that the script will need. Add the following JSON to the file and fill in the values:
`{
     "database":"",
     "username":"",
     "password":"",
     "host":"",
     "port":""
 }`
5. Save it with the name "db.conf"
6. Execute the script as follows: ./circ-data-load.sh db.conf \<tenant-ID\>

To run the database restore script:
1. Go to an AWS EC2 jump box that's in the same environment as that DB.
2. Execute > psql -f checkin-checkout-db-restore.sql -a --echo-all -h \<database-host-name\> -U \<db-username\> -d \<db-name\>
3. Enter password when prompted
  
## JMeter-supported-data
### Runtime Data
The following data files are needed to support the Jmeter script during its execution.
- Available.csv: a list barcodes that have Available status
- checked_out.csv: a list of barcodes that although have Avaialble status may be considered as "checked out" so that they can be used in the check-in calls.
- credentials.csv: a file to specify credentials for the tennant being tested.
- user_barcodes.scv: a list of barcodes of actual patronIDs that will be used to check in/out with.

### Non-runtime Data
- circulation-seed-data.zip: This zip file is used by the circ-data-load.sh script. It contains seed data for requests, loans, and related loans/requests data. It needs to be unpacked and the files are placed in the same directory as the circ-data-load.sh script.
